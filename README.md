# Light_MVC_FW
a very simple/ready to use MVC framework

This project aims to provide a very easy and light MVC (Model View and Controller) Framework 
that just need to be inserted in your script list and then you'll jut need to add method that would be call 
through event in your page.

As of now, an older version of this is used in another of my project (Huanga) and is curently updating to the current one so feel free to look at the source code to see how it can be possibly implemented (however prepare aspirin with you as it's really messy!! what you'll find in the DEMO\ folder is much cleaner!!).
